
- What does validCandidate expect and return?
	Expects a string or an array of strings and returns a boolean.

- Tell us the reason(s) why we've created a variable to store the regex?
	To validate if the string(s) inserted on the function parameter 'languages' ends with the string "script".

- Does it matter to use == or === when checking if typeof languages is equal to 'string' ?
	On this case, since it is using the typeof, there is no need to use ===, that makes an identity comparison on the data type.

- Rewrite filter so it doesn't use =>. What does => do? Was it necessary in this instance?
	validCandidate = !!languages.filter( function(lang) { return languageRegex.test(lang) }).length 
  
	=> replaces the function declaration (eg: function(value){...}), shorter syntax. 
  
	Can be easier to read. 

- Update validCandidate to accept candidate knowing "ES2015", "ES6" or "ES7". Basically ES whatever. By the way, what does "ES" stand for?
	let languageRegex  = /^ES|script$/;	
	ES - ECSMAScript

- Nice to have: write validCandidate unit tests.
